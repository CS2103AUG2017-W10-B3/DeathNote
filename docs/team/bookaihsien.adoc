_Figure 4.2.1 : Open New Address Book Sequence Diagram_

As you can see from the diagram, when the `Open` button is clicked in the Application, it raises an event and triggers `MainApp` to update new Application metadata and restart the UI.

This loads the selected XML file which opens a new address book with contacts from selected XML file.

=== Enhancement Added: Improve `find` command

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W10-B3/DeathNote/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[from: User Guide]#

Finds persons who matches the given attributes. +

  Format: `find [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [b/BIRTHDAY] [w/WEBSITE] [t/TAG]... `

  Shorthand: `f [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [b/BIRTHDAY] [w/WEBSITE] [t/TAG]...`

* Searches based on the input and prefix.
* The search is case insensitive for NAME. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords for NAME does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* The other prefixes require the exact words
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
